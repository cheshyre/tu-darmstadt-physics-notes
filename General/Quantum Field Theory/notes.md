# Preface

These notes are adapted from the "Introduction to Quantum Field Theory" course
taught by M. Buballa at the TU Darmstadt during the summer semester in 2019.
The course was originally taught in German, but these notes are being written
in English to be more useful to the broader physics community. In the process
of writing these notes, the structure and content of the course has been
adapted a little. In particular, these notes contain more thorough derivations
of key results, which were often left as exercises to the student. However,
fundamentally the content is still the same as presented by M. Buballa.

Quantum field theory is a critical tool in many modern research areas in
physics. As such, it forms the basis for many methods used in calculations,
such as effective field theories and path-integral calculations. While this
course will not be able to cover all of these topics, it will cover the
foundations. As a result, learning about these foundations in a quantum field
theory course should be of great interest to many physics students. These
notes aim to offer a self-contained treatment on the level of a graduate
student in physics familiar with classical mechanics (the Lagrangian
formulation), electrodynamics, and quantum mechanics.
