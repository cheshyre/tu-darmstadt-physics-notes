# Scope and guiding principles

## Scope

- focus on low-energy nuclear physics
- interested in properties and interactions of nuclei and nuclear matter
  - for nuclei:
    - ground state and low-lying ($< 50$ MeV) excited states
  - for nuclear matter:
    - equation of state at low densities (low temperature)
- spans the subfields nuclear structure, nuclear reactions, and nuclear astrophysics
- involves all four forces
  - for this reason, nuclei are an effective lab for the search for new physics

## Guiding principles

### Focus on modern developments and new perspectives

- from effective theories to many-body physics
- modern approaches unite (following) guiding principles for a more systematic
and predictive description of nuclear systems

### Resolution
- key idea: fine details at short distances are not important for reproduction of
long-distance features
- low energies correspond to low momenta
$$
E = \frac{p^2}{2m}
$$
- by Compton wavelenfth, low momenta correspond to long wavelengths (long distances)
$$
p = \frac{h}{\lambda}
$$
- at low energies, we have limited resolution
  - details at short distances (much smaller than $\lambda$) are not resolved
- we will leverage this to build systematic effective theories valid at low energies

### Effective theories

**Example: multipole expansion in electrostatics**

What is the electric potential $\Phi$ of a localized charge distribution at long distances?
